### Policy History Conference Organizer

Personal project to retrieve data from Google Sheets and use it to populate a MySQL database, with the intent to eventually expose that data through a REST API

Next Steps 
- deal with participants who are not presenters (and guard against duplicate entries, eg a participant who is also the organizer of the panel)
- get document urls from Google Drive into database
- write CRUD methods for data
